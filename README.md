<p>The sum of thrown numbers is cumulated until the player rolls <b>1 point</b>.

<p>If the player rolls <b>1 point</b>, they lose both their turn and all of the points gained thus far.

<p>The player rolling the dice can choose between actually rolling and giving up their turn, therefore saving all of their points.

<p>The player who cumulates <b>100 points</b> first wins.
