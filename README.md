# The simple dice game

A simple game about rolling the dice.

The sum of thrown numbers is cumulated until the player rolls 1 point.

If the player rolls 1 point, they lose both their turn and all of the points gained thus far.

The player rolling the dice can choose between actually rolling and giving up their turn,
therefore saving all of their points.

The player who cumulates 100 points first wins.
